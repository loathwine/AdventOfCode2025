// The simplest possible sbt build file is just one line:

scalaVersion := "3.7.4"
// That is, to create a valid sbt build, all you've got to do is define the
// version of Scala you'd like your project to use.

// ============================================================================

// Lines like the above defining `scalaVersion` are called "settings". Settings
// are key/value pairs. In the case of `scalaVersion`, the key is "scalaVersion"
// and the value is "2.13.1"

// It's possible to define many kinds of settings, such as:

name    := "aoc-2025"
version := "1.0"

// Note, it's not required for you to define these three settings. These are
// mostly only necessary if you intend to publish your library's binaries on a
// place like Sonatype or Bintray.

// Want to use a published library in your project?
// You can define other libraries as dependencies in your build like this:
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
//  "org.typelevel" %% "cats-core" % "2.9.0",
  "dev.zio"              %% "zio"               % "2.1.23",
  "dev.zio"              %% "zio-streams"       % "2.1.23",
  "dev.zio"              %% "zio-prelude"       % "1.0.0-RC44",
  "io.github.kitlangton" %% "neotype"           % "0.3.37",
  "dev.optics"           %% "monocle-core"      % "3.3.0",
  "dev.optics"           %% "monocle-macro"     % "3.3.0",
  // Breeze for matrix operations
  "org.scalanlp"         %% "breeze"            % "2.1.0",
  "org.scalanlp"         %% "breeze-viz"        % "2.1.0",
  // Scala 3 matrix operations
  "io.github.dieproht"   %% "matr-bundle"       % "0.0.7",
  // Mathematical programming Scala (Linear programming, integer programming etc)
  "com.github.vagmcs"    %% "optimus"           % "3.4.5",
  "com.github.vagmcs"    %% "optimus-solver-oj" % "3.4.5",
  "com.github.vagmcs"    %% "optimus-solver-lp" % "3.4.5",
  // Image generation
  "org.creativescala"    %% "doodle"            % "0.32.0",
  // Refined types
  "io.github.iltotore"   %% "iron"              % "3.2.1",
  // Monocle
  "dev.optics"           %% "monocle-core"      % "3.3.0",
  "dev.optics"           %% "monocle-macro"     % "3.3.0",
)

// IMPORTANT NOTE: while build files look _kind of_ like regular Scala, it's
// important to note that syntax in *.sbt files doesn't always behave like
// regular Scala. For example, notice in this build file that it's not required
// to put our settings into an enclosing object or class. Always remember that
// sbt is a bit different, semantically, than vanilla Scala.

// ============================================================================

// Most moderately interesting Scala projects don't make use of the very simple
// build file style (called "bare style") used in this build.sbt file. Most
// intermediate Scala projects make use of so-called "multi-project" builds. A
// multi-project build makes it possible to have different folders which sbt can
// be configured differently for. That is, you may wish to have different
// dependencies or different testing frameworks defined for different parts of
// your codebase. Multi-project builds make this possible.

// Here's a quick glimpse of what a multi-project build looks like for this
// build, with only one "subproject" defined, called `root`:

// lazy val root = (project in file(".")).
//   settings(
//     inThisBuild(List(
//       organization := "ch.epfl.scala",
//       scalaVersion := "2.13.1"
//     )),
//     name := "hello-world"
//   )

// To learn more about multi-project builds, head over to the official sbt
// documentation at http://www.scala-sbt.org/documentation.html
